My first repository

Hi there, I'm a recent Biology BSc graduate that's going into a Computer Science MSc.

I'm interested in a career as a data scientist, so I'm looking to learn more about Python and R in order to gain the tools for machine learning and data mining. I'd also like to learn more about Java, although I've learnt a small amount about it already and I think it's a little less important in data science than R or python.
